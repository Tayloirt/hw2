<p> Welcome to techVine! Here at techVine users can become more
connected within tech. Visit our site to learn more about conferences, scholarships,
and opportunities available for students of color interested in technology careers.
Last year it was reported that just 2.5 percent of employees are
Black and 3.6 percent are Latinx. techVine's mission is to bridge the gap
between technology and those who are underrepresented in the field!</p>
